# Week 2
The order of the files is the following:
1. bwt.py
2. bwtinverse.py
3. bwtmatching.py
4. suffix_array.py

Of all the "BWT Inverse" files, the fastest solution is `bwtinverse_fast.py`. It is based on the "Counting Sort" algorithm. A few other solutions also have the desired algorithmic complexity.

Within "BWT Matching", the fastest solution is `bwmatching_13.py`. Solutions 11-15 have the desired algorithmic complexity.
